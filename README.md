# Librespot Daemon (librespotd)

This will eventually become the easy to use, bells-and-whistles daemon that uses librespot to provide it's functionality.

Right now, it is mostly a placeholder repo, and the reccomendation is to continue using librespot. We will make it clear on Gitter and here when we think librespotd is ready to be the main application.
